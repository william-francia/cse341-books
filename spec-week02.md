# Books API Week 02 Spec - Version 1

## Feature 1: Book CRUD Operations and Author References

### Goal
Update the existing Week 01 book API so book documents include a reference to an author and the API supports all CRUD operations for books. Every book route must be documented and testable in Swagger.

### Data Model
Book documents will be stored in the `books` collection.

Required book fields:
- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `b1`
- `authorId`: string, required, references the `id` field of an author document
- `title`: string, required
- `publicationDate`: string, required

Books will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Relationship to Authors
Each book will identify its author with an `authorId` field. The value of `authorId` must match the custom `id` value of an existing author document.

When creating or updating a book, the API should reject the request with a `400` status code if the submitted `authorId` does not match an existing author.

### Routes

#### GET /books
Purpose: Return all books.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of book objects

Errors:
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### GET /books/:id
Purpose: Return one book by its custom id.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching book object

Errors:
- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### POST /books
Purpose: Create a new book.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "b4",
      "authorId": "a1",
      "title": "Example Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-01-15"
    }

Success:
- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `id` already exists
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### PUT /books/:id
Purpose: Update an existing book.

Request body:

    {
      "authorId": "a2",
      "title": "Updated Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-02-20"
    }

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author
- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### DELETE /books/:id
Purpose: Delete an existing book.

Success:
- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:
- `404` if no book exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

### Swagger Documentation
Swagger must document every book route.

### Deployment Expectations
After implementation, the book routes must work locally and from the deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must allow someone to test every book route from the browser.










## Feature 2: Author CRUD Operations









### Goal
Create an authors collection that stores author information and provides CRUD operations. Each author must have a custom id, name, and birth year. Every author route must be documented and testable in Swagger. Authors cannot be deleted while books still reference their id.

### Data Model
Author documents will be stored in the `authors` collection.

Required author fields:
- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `a1`
- `name`: string, required
- `birthYear`: number, required

authors will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Relationship to Books

Books use `authorId` to reference an author. One author can have many books.

An author cannot be deleted if books still use their `id`. The API returns `400`.

### Routes  

#### GET /authors
Purpose: return all the authors.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of author objects

Errors:
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### GET /authors/:id
Purpose: Return one author by its custom id.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching author object

Errors:
- `404` if no author exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### POST /authors

Purpose: Create a new author.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "a1",
      "name": "J. K. Rowling",
      "birthYear": 1965
    }

Success:
- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created author object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing
- `400` if the `id` already exists
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### PUT /authors/:id

Purpose: Update an existing author.

Request body:

    {
      "name": "Updated Author Name",
      "birthYear": 1970
    }

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated author object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing
- `404` if no author exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs

#### DELETE /authors/:id

Purpose: Delete an existing author.

Success:
- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:
- `400` if books still reference the author
- `404` if no author exists with that id
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs


### Swagger Documentation
Swagger must document every authors route.

### Deployment Expectations
After implementation, the author routes must work locally and from the deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must allow someone to test every author route from the browser.
